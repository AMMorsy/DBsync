# DBsync

DBsync is a lightweight PowerShell automation script that **synchronizes a remote PostgreSQL database** to a local development environment.  
It handles every step from remote dump to local restore, migration, and privilege repair ‚Äî all in one run.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure remote dump** via SSH (`pg_dump` on the remote server)
- **Automatic local restore** using `pg_restore` (atomic, transactional)
- **Runs Django migrations** after restore to keep schema in sync
- **Grants/repairs permissions** for the Django database user
- **Verifies key tables** after import (basic sanity check)
- **Auto-detects PostgreSQL bin path** (works even if not in PATH)
- **Optional cleanup** for remote and local dump files
- **Session-safe PATH injection** (no registry edits, no global pollution)

---

## üß© Requirements

- Windows with **PowerShell 5+**  
- **PostgreSQL client tools** (pg_dump, pg_restore, psql) installed locally  
- Access to the remote host via **SSH (key or password)**  
- Optional: Python/Django project with `manage.py` available for migrations  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the top of `sync_and_migrate.ps1` and update placeholders to match your setup:

```powershell
$RemoteUser = "<remote_ssh_user>"
$RemoteHost = "<remote_host_or_ip>"
$RemotePort = 22
$RemoteDb   = "<remote_database_name>"

$DbUser = "<local_postgres_superuser>"
$DbName = "<local_database_name>"
$ProjectRoot = "C:\Path\To\Your\Project"
```

If you use a Django app with a specific database role, update:
```powershell
$AppRoleFallback = "<django_app_db_user>"
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Open **PowerShell** and run:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Path\To\DBsync"
   .\sync_and_migrate.ps1
   ```
2. The script will:
   - Create a remote dump on the server
   - Copy it locally via `scp`
   - Drop & recreate your local database
   - Restore the dump atomically
   - Run Django migrations (if configured)
   - Apply and refresh all database privileges
   - Verify key data and clean up dump files

---

## üîê Security Notes

- No passwords are hard-coded.
- You can temporarily set your local DB password via:
  ```powershell
  $env:PGPASSWORD = "your_password"
  ```
- All SSH operations respect your user‚Äôs SSH config and keys.
- Dumps are deleted after restore unless `$KeepRemoteDump` or `$KeepLocalDump` are set to `$true`.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|----------|--------|-----|
| `psql.exe not found` | PostgreSQL client not installed or PATH not set | Update `$PgBin` or install PostgreSQL |
| `permission denied for table django_migrations` | App role lacks rights | Fixed automatically in Step 7 |
| SSH fails | wrong port or missing key | Verify `$RemoteUser`, `$RemoteHost`, and `$RemotePort` |
